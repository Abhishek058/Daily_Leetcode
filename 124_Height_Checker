You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.

class Solution {
public:
    int heightChecker(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int> newHeight = heights;
        sort(heights.begin(), heights.end());
        int cnt = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<heights.size(); i++){
            if(heights[i] != newHeight[i]){
                cnt++;
            }
        }

        return cnt;
    }
};
