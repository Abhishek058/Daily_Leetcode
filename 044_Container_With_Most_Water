You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

C++


class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int ans = 0;
        int n = height.size()-1;
        int i=0;
        int j = n;
        while(i<j){
            ans = max(ans, min(height[i], height[j]) * n);
            if(height[i] >= height[j]){
                j--;
            }
            else{
                i++;
            }
            n--;
        }
        return ans;
