C++

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& a) {

        int max = 0,min=INT_MAX;

        for(int i=0;i<a.size();i++)
        {
            if(min > a[i])
            {
                min =  a[i];
            }

            if(max < a[i]-min)
            {
                max = a[i] - min;
            }

        }

        return max;
        
    }
