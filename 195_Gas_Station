There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int less = 0, balance = 0, start = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<gas.length; i++){
            balance += gas[i] - cost[i];
            if(balance < 0){
                less += balance;
                balance = 0;
                start = i+1;
            }
        }

        if(less + balance >= 0){
            return start;
        }
        else{
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
