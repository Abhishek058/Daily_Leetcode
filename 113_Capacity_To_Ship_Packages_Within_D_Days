Here's the general idea:

Find the minimum and maximum possible capacity for a ship. The minimum capacity would be the maximum value in the array (since a package cannot be split), and the maximum capacity would be the sum of all elements in the array (since a ship cannot carry more than the total weight).

Perform a binary search between the minimum and maximum capacities. In each iteration of the binary search, calculate the mid capacity and simulate the process of shipping packages using this capacity.

Count how many days are required to ship all the packages using the current mid capacity. If the number of days required is greater than D, it means the capacity is too small, so move the search range to the right half. Otherwise, if the number of days required is less than or equal to D, it means the capacity is sufficient or can be further minimized, so move the search range to the left half.

Continue the binary search until the left and right pointers meet.

Return the minimum capacity where the packages can be shipped within D days.

This approach is quite intuitive and easy to understand. It ensures that you're searching for the minimum capacity by narrowing down the range using binary search based on whether the number of days required is within the given limit D or not.

class Solution {
public:
    int shipWithinDays(vector<int>& weights, int days) {
        int max = *max_element(weights.begin(), weights.end());
        int sum = 0;
        for(int i : weights){
            sum += i;
        }
        int s = max, e = sum;
        while(s<e){
            int m = s + (e-s)/2;

            int currentDays = 1;
            int currentCapacity = 0;
            
            for (int weight : weights) {
                if (currentCapacity + weight > m) {
                    currentDays++;
                    currentCapacity = 0;
                }
                currentCapacity += weight;
            }
            if(currentDays > days){
                s = m + 1;
            }
            else{
                e = m;
            }
        }

        return s;
    }
};
