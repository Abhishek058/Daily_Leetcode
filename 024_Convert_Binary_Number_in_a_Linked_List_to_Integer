Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the binary representation of a number.

Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.

The most significant bit is at the head of the linked list.

C++

class Solution {
public:
    int getDecimalValue(ListNode* head) {
        int res = 0;
        if(head == NULL){
            return 0;
        }
        while(head){
            res = res * 2 + head->val;
            head = head->next;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
